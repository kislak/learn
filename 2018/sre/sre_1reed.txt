Pursuing Maximum Change Velocity Without Violating a Service’s SLO

There are three kinds of valid monitoring output:
alert
ticket
logging

Reliability is a function of mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair (MTTR)
  R = mttf/mttr

machine - rack - row - cluster - datacenter - campus
borg - distributed cluster operating system
bns - borg name service (name ->  ip:port)
hdfs - Hadoop Distributed File System
Google File System -> Colossus (BigTable, Spanner, Blobstore)
Global Software Load Balancer (GSLB)
  dns
  service
  RPC
// name, {BNS list -> capacity (RPS)}

The Chubby lock service provides - Paxos protocol for asynchronous Consensus

monitoring:
Set up alerting for acute problems.
Compare behavior: did a software update make the server faster?
Examine how resource consumption behavior evolves over time, which is essential for capacity planning.
